# Pokédex

This is a Pokédex web application that allows users to view information about all Pokemon in the Pokémon universe, as well as search for Pokémon by name.  
This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## How to Use  
### Viewing Pokémon  
When you first open the Pokédex, you will see the first 40 Pokémon listed. To view more information about a specific Pokémon, simply click on its card.  
This will open a popup with additional information, including the Pokémon's stats, types, and more specifications.  

### Searching for Pokémon  
To search for a specific Pokémon by name, simply type the name of the Pokémon into the search bar at the top of the page. 
The Pokédex will automatically filter the list of Pokémon to show only those that match your search query.  

### Load more Pokémon  
If you want to view more than the initial 40 Pokémon, simply scroll to the bottom of the page.  
The Pokédex will automatically load the next set of Pokémon as you scroll.
